My name is Mihai Nadăș, and I am a passionate PhD student at Babeș-Bolyai University, diving deep into the exciting and ever-evolving field of artificial intelligence. My research focuses on areas such as machine learning, natural language processing, and large language models—fields that are not only intellectually stimulating but also hold immense potential for shaping the future.

With over a decade of experience in the IT industry, I have had the privilege of working in diverse roles, from software development to leading teams and managing large-scale projects. However, my journey as a PhD student is a return to my roots: a commitment to continuous learning, critical thinking, and pushing the boundaries of what technology can achieve. I approach my research with the mindset of a lifelong learner, eager to explore the unknown and contribute meaningfully to the AI community.

This blog is a space for me to share my thoughts, experiences, and insights as I navigate the complexities of AI research. Whether it’s a breakthrough I find exciting, a challenge I’ve struggled with, or simply reflections on the intersection of academia and industry, my goal is to offer a genuine and transparent account of my journey. I also hope this platform becomes a bridge to connect with like-minded individuals—students, researchers, practitioners, or anyone curious about AI.

Above all, I approach this journey with humility. I am fully aware of how much there is to learn and how vast this field is, but I believe that meaningful progress comes from collaboration and sharing knowledge. I invite you to join me as I document my exploration of this incredible field, contribute to the larger conversation, and hopefully inspire others along the way.
