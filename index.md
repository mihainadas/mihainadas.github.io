Hey! I'm Mihai, a PhD student at Babe»ô-Bolyai University, specializing in Small Language Models (SLMs) for Romanian. My passion lies in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML).

## A blog about machine learning and natural language processing

Beyond my research, I find joy in teaching and sharing my expertise in ML. I firmly believe in the power of education and aim to inspire others. My mission is to enhance language models for Romanian, thereby improving NLP applications and making them more practical.

In this blog, you'll find a variety of posts ranging from in-depth tutorials on machine learning algorithms to the latest advancements in NLP. I also share insights from my research, including challenges faced and solutions discovered. Whether you're a beginner or an expert, there's something here for everyone.

I frequently update the blog with new content, so be sure to check back often. Additionally, I welcome feedback and discussions, as I believe that collaboration is key to advancing our understanding and application of these technologies.
