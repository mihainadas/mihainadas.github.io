Hey! 👋 I’m Mihai, a PhD student at Babeș-Bolyai University, specializing in Small Language Models (SLMs) for Romanian. My passion lies in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML).

## A blog about machine learning and natural language processing 🧠💻

Beyond my research, I find joy in teaching and sharing my expertise in ML. I firmly believe in the power of education and aim to inspire others. My mission is to enhance language models for Romanian, thereby improving NLP applications and making them more practical. 🌍📚

In this blog, you’ll find a variety of posts ranging from in-depth tutorials on machine learning algorithms to the latest advancements in NLP. I also share insights from my research, including challenges faced and solutions discovered. Whether you’re a beginner or an expert, there’s something here for everyone.

### 🌐 Language of the Blog

While most of the content on this blog will be in English to ensure it is accessible to a global audience, you’ll also find some articles written in Romanian. 🇷🇴 These are intended to support local developers, researchers, and enthusiasts who are particularly interested in Romanian NLP and its applications. My goal is to balance accessibility with relevance, making the blog useful both internationally and within Romania.

I frequently update the blog with new content, so be sure to check back often. 🔄 Additionally, I welcome feedback and discussions, as I believe that collaboration is key to advancing our understanding and application of these technologies. 🤝
