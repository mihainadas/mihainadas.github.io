## About myself
Hey! I'm a PhD student at Babe»ô-Bolyai University, working on Small Language Models (SLMs) for Romanian. I'm really into Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML).

When I'm not doing research, I enjoy teaching and sharing my knowledge about ML. I believe education is powerful and I want to inspire others. My goal is to improve language models for Romanian, making NLP applications better and more useful.
